# WPF-Control-Explorer
WPF Control Explorer is a simple tool that allows you to explore the various built-in controls used in creating WPF desktop applications. The various properties, methods and events of each control can be easily discovered, together with the relevant .Net class name, member definitions and any static members that may be available on the properties.

The tool is a useful quick-reference when creating WPF applications, and can also be used to learn the various members of the native WPF controls.
